## 📚 MODULE 1: LESSONS 1-10

### Lesson 1: What Credit Really Is
**Objective**: Students will understand credit as a financial tool and its role in the economy.

**Introduction**: Credit is not debt—it is access. Understanding this distinction changes everything.

**Core Instruction**:
1. Credit is the ability to obtain goods or services before payment, based on trust that payment will be made in the future.
2. It is a contractual agreement between lender and borrower.
3. Credit enables economic growth by allowing consumers to make purchases they could not afford immediately.
4. Your creditworthiness is measured and recorded by credit bureaus.
5. Responsible credit use builds financial opportunity; misuse creates long-term barriers.

**Summary**: Credit is a tool. Like any tool, it can build or destroy depending on how you use it.

### Lesson 2: Why Credit Scores Exist
**Objective**: Students will understand the purpose and function of credit scoring systems.

**Introduction**: Before credit scores, lending decisions were subjective and often discriminatory. Scores were created to standardize risk assessment.

**Core Instruction**:
1. Credit scores were developed to predict the likelihood of loan repayment.
2. FICO introduced the first widely-used credit score in 1989.
3. Scores allow lenders to make faster, more consistent decisions.
4. They reduce (but do not eliminate) bias in lending.
5. Scores range from 300-850, with higher scores indicating lower risk.
6. Multiple scoring models exist (FICO, VantageScore), but FICO is most widely used.

**Summary**: Your score is a risk prediction tool. It does not measure your worth—it measures your payment patterns.

### Lesson 3: The Five Factors of a Credit Score
**Objective**: Students will identify and explain the five components of FICO credit scoring.

**Introduction**: Your credit score is not random. It is calculated using five weighted factors. Knowing them gives you control.

**Core Instruction**:
1. Payment History (35%): Whether you pay bills on time.
2. Amounts Owed (30%): How much credit you are using relative to your limits.
3. Length of Credit History (15%): How long your accounts have been open.
4. New Credit (10%): Recent credit inquiries and new accounts.
5. Credit Mix (10%): Variety of credit types (cards, loans, mortgages).
6. Payment history is the single most important factor.
7. These percentages are approximate and may vary slightly by individual.

**Summary**: Master these five factors, and you master your score. Ignore them, and your score masters you.

### Lesson 4: Payment History Explained
**Objective**: Students will understand how payment history is calculated and its impact on credit scores.

**Introduction**: Payment history is 35% of your score. One late payment can drop your score by 100 points.

**Core Instruction**:
1. Payment history tracks whether you pay bills by the due date.
2. Payments more than 30 days late are reported to credit bureaus.
3. The severity of late payments increases at 60, 90, and 120+ days.
4. Recent late payments hurt more than old ones.
5. Charge-offs, collections, and bankruptcies severely damage this category.
6. Positive payment history rebuilds over time but requires consistency.
7. Even one missed payment can remain on your report for 7 years.

**Summary**: Your payment history is your financial reputation. Protect it like your life depends on it—because financially, it does.

### Lesson 5: Credit Utilization Explained
**Objective**: Students will calculate credit utilization and understand its impact on scores.

**Introduction**: Credit utilization is the second most important factor in your score. Most people do not understand how it works.

**Core Instruction**:
1. Utilization is the percentage of available credit you are using.
2. Formula: (Total Balances / Total Credit Limits) × 100.
3. Experts recommend keeping utilization below 30%.
4. Utilization below 10% is ideal for score optimization.
5. Both overall utilization and per-card utilization matter.
6. Utilization is calculated monthly based on statement balances.
7. Paying down balances before the statement date can improve utilization immediately.

**Summary**: Low utilization signals financial control. High utilization signals risk. Control your balances, control your score.
