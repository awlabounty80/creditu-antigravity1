## The Algorithm That Controls Your Life

Most people treat their credit score like a grade in school—something to be "maintained." This is a poverty mindset. In the Billionaire''s playbook, a credit score is not a metric of responsibility; it is a **key to liquidity**.

The FICO 8 algorithm is a mathematical model that predicts the likelihood of you defaulting on a debt in the next 90 days. That is all it is. It is not a judgment of your soul. It is a risk assessment engine. Once you understand the engine, you can hack it.

There are 5 distinct levers you can pull. We call these the **FICO DNA**.

---

## 1. Payment History (35%)
### The "Don''t Miss" Zone

This is the bedrock. 35% of your score is purely: *Did you pay on time?*

But here is the secret: **"On Time" in the real world means by the due date. "On Time" in the credit world means within 29 days of the due date.**

Banks cannot report you late to the bureaus until you are **30 days** past due.
- **Day 1 Late:** You pay a late fee. Internal record only.
- **Day 15 Late:** You get a phone call. Internal record only.
- **Day 29 Late:** You are sweating. Internal record only.
- **Day 30 Late:** **BOOM.** It hits your credit report. Score drops 50-100 points.

### The Strategy:
If you are struggling, you never, ever let it hit Day 30. You can negotiate a late fee reversal. You cannot easily negotiate a 30-day late marker removal (though we have methods for that in the Restoration module).

**Billionaire Move:** Autopay is for amateurs. Use **Credit Alignment**. Set all your credit card due dates to the 1st or the 15th of the month by calling the banks. Align your cash flow.

## 2. Amounts Owed / Utilization (30%)
### The "High Balance" Illusion

This is where 90% of people fail. They think "I pay my bill in full every month, so I''m good."
**WRONG.**

The credit bureaus do not see when you pay. They see what your balance is **on the Statement Closing Date**.

### The Statement Date vs. Due Date
- **Closing Date:** The day the bill prints. The bank takes a snapshot of your balance and sends it to the bureaus.
- **Due Date:** Usually 20-25 days *after* the Closing Date.

If you have a $1,000 limit and you spend $900, and the statement closes... the Bureau sees **90% utilization**. Your score tanks. Even if you pay it off 2 days later on the Due Date!

### The AZEO Method (All Zero Except One)
To get a perfect 850 score, you need **1-3% utilization**, not 30%.
1. Pay off every single card to $0 **before** the Statement Closing Date.
2. Leave **one** card with a tiny balance (like $10 or $20).
3. The bureaus see "0, 0, 0, 0, 0, $10".
4. This signals: "He uses credit, but he needs none of it."

**That is power.**

## 3. Length of Credit History (15%)
### The "Time Travel" Factor

You cannot rush time... or can you?
This factor averages the age of all your open accounts.

- Opening a new card **lowers** your average age.
- Closing an old card **removes** that history (eventually).

### Never Close Your First Card
Your oldest card is your anchor. Even if it has a crappy annual fee, downgrade it to a free version. Keep it open forever.

### Piggybacking (Authorized Users)
This is the cheat code.
If your grandmother has a generic Discover card open since 1985 with perfect payment history...
If she adds you as an **Authorized User**, her 40 years of history get copied and pasted onto YOUR report.
You instantly look like you have been managing credit since before you were born.

**Warning:** Only do this with people who have PERFECT execution. If they miss a payment, you miss a payment.

---

## 4. New Credit (10%)
### The "Desperation" Signal

Every time you apply for credit, you get a **Hard Inquiry**.
- **Hard Pull:** You asked for money. (Score drops 3-5 points).
- **Soft Pull:** You checked your rate, or existing bank checked you. (Score unaffected).

Inquiries stay on your report for 2 years, but they only hurt your score for **12 months**.
If you have 10 inquiries in a month, you look desperate / broke. Banks hate desperate people.
If you have 0 inquiries in 2 years, you look stagnant.

**The Sweet Spot:** Apply for credit in "sprees." Apply for 3-4 cards on the same day. The inquiries merge or happen simultaneously before the new accounts hit the report.

---

## 5. Credit Mix (10%)
### The "Portfolio" Facade

Banks want to see that you can handle different *types* of debt.
- **Revolving Credit:** Credit Cards, Lines of Credit. (Variable payments).
- **Installment Loans:** Auto Loans, Mortgages, Student Loans. (Fixed payments).

If you only have credit cards, you are capped. You need an installment loan to break the 800 barrier securely.

### The Self-Lender Hack
Don''t go buy a car just to get a loan. Use a "Credit Builder Loan" (like Self or a Credit Union secured loan).
You lend money to *yourself*, pay yourself back, and the bank reports it as an installment loan.
It costs you a few dollars in interest, but it buys you the "Mix" badge in the algorithm.

## Conclusion: The Perfect Profile
To be funding ready ($100k+ in unsecured lines), your DNA must look like this:

1. **100% Payment History** (No lates).
2. **<3% Utilization** (AZEO method).
3. **5+ Years Average Age** (Au or patience).
4. **<2 Inquiries** in the last 6 months.
5. **Mix** of Revolving + Installment.

Build this profile, and you don''t ask banks for money. **You demand it.**
