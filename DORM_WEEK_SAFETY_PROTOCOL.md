# DORM_WEEK_SAFETY_PROTOCOL.md

## VERSION: DORM_WEEK_YARD_V1_LOCKED_02_19_26

### 🚨 CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULE 🚨
The files `src/pages/public/DormWeek.tsx` and `src/pages/public/DormWeek_TAKEOVER_BACKUP.tsx` are considered **IMMUTABLE SNAPSHOTS** of the "YARD / HOMECOMING" build.

#### Before ANY future edits to these files, the following protocol MUST be followed:

1. **Auto-Backup**: Create a timestamped copy in `/snapshots/` containing the exact current state.
2. **Explicit Confirmation**: The USER must explicitly approve the edit after reviewing the proposed changes.
3. **No Silent Overrides**: Do not use `Overwrite: true` without a specific reason and user consent.
4. **Structural Preservation**: Do NOT simplify, redesign, or modernize the aesthetics. The "Hi-Vibe / Theatrical Fun" aesthetic (Floating cards, money signs, graffiti text) must be preserved.
5. **Dependency Drift Check**: Ensure any new dependencies do not conflict with the locked versions in `package.json`.
